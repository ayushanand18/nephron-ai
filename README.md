## Abstract
The kidneys are complex and resilient organs, each roughly the size of a fist. But many medical conditions can strain the kidneys, including diabetes, and high blood pressure causing chronic kidney disease. Chronic Kidney Disease is a major public health problem that affects 1.6 billion people globally each year. Around 10% of world population suffers from the disease and can cause complications including kidney failures, an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemia. Chronic Kidney disease is a five-stage disease, often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced (For this reason, Chronic Kidney Disease is also referred to as a “silent disease”). Kidney disease causes gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months to years.
Each year, chronic kidney disease kills more people than breast or prostate cancer. And patient awareness is less than 10% in stages 1 to 3. Unfortunately, there has not been much research done on fighting the disease and there is an apparent lack of seriousness among public health officials against this silent healthcare crisis.
Chronic kidney disease can be treated. With early diagnosis and treatment, it's possible to slow or stop the progression of kidney disease.
Existing research works (even though very scarce) have focused only on detection of the disease. However, in order to tackle a disease on such a large scale a more comprehensive work must be done. Therefore, I came up with the idea to tackle chronic kidney disease using a three step approach – early detection, knowing the underlying cause and recommending a lifestyle approach to minimize risks – using one of the most advanced technology in computational intelligence, ‘deep learning’. The work has been implemented to make a web-based solution – NephronAI, which is accessible to anybody for free with the ease of a web browser.
A typical prediction using NephronAI (diagnosis, etiology, and creation of recommended approach) takes less than 10 minutes for a new user, without costing any money. Therefore, it proves to be a zero-cost, accessible, and comprehensive, tool to tackle Chronic Kidney Disease.

## Question
*How can we fight Chronic Kidney Disease using deep learning?*<br>
*How to create an AI system that not just only detects diseases but also understand the underlying cause?*

## Hypothesis
I was successful in making a web-based solution, ***NephronAI*** for **“Early detection** and **understanding of** underlying **cause** of a **Chronic Kidney Disease** using **deep learning**"

## Background Research
Kidneys are essentials organs that filter some 140 litres of blood each day, leaving behind a litre or two of water and waste in the form of urine. Each kidney features a latticework of roughly one million tiny filtering units, called nephrons. Blood entering a nephron passes through a cluster of tiny vessels called the glomerulus. The thin walls of the glomerulus enable waste, water and other small molecules to pass through, while blocking larger ones such as proteins and blood cells. From there, the filtered fluid flows into kidney tubules, where the balance of minerals, water, salts and glucose is calibrated and molecules necessary for bodily functions are reabsorbed into the bloodstream. But many medical conditions are depleting the function of kidneys. Diabetic people, and those suffering from hypertension are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease. In the most advanced stages of Chronic Kidney Disease the survival rate is less than 5 years- shorter than for many cancers.
The treatment is also very costly, as much as $91,000 annually per patient in the United States. And as well as using a lot of water, the current approach consumes vast quantities of power and materials such as plastics. However, if we increase patient awareness, make self-testing of kidney disease easy for vulnerable groups than we can save millions of lives and billions of dollars each year.
The diagnosis of chronic kidney disease typically involves a blood test to measure the glomerular filtration rate (to check how well your kidneys are filtering your blood) and a urine test to check for albumin. If your glomerular filtration rate is lower than normal, that indicates chronic kidney disease. While access to physicians and high-grade healthcare facilities is still not available to many poor people, plus some physicians will turn away patients not because they do not need care but to reduce lab costs or because their insurers pay relatively less. A computational approach can effectively address all the above issues- cost, accessibility, and accuracy.

## Data Analysis
**Trends in data: Chronic Kidney Disease detection**<br>
Data for detection of chronic kidney disease clearly show correlation between parameters used to assess and the probability of being affected. For the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease a comprehensive data containing specific gravity[1], albumin[2] (in urine), serum creatinine[3], hemoglobin[4], packed cell volume[5], white blood cell count[6], red blood count[7], hypertension[8] from the lab reports of patients were analyzed. The trend between these values and the diagnosis is outlined below.

**Trends in data: Causes behind Chronic Kidney Disease**<br>
From data available at the US NIH, the fact that some medical conditions account for development of chronic kidney disease in many patients is evident.

Individuals who are diabetic (both type I and II) the risk for developing chronic kidney disease is very high. The following data shows the rate per million population of those requiring hemodialysis (treatment in advanced stages of chronic kidney disease).

----
## Functioning
The application works via a three-phase approach – diagnosis or detection of disease, etiology or finding the underlying cause, and the last step recommending a lifestyle approach to reduce complications based on the cause detected.

The following graphic shows the way the application works.

## Conclusion
How the project fulfills the question?
The project was successful in creating a tri-faced approach to fight chronic kidney disease. Upon large-scale implementation, it will prove to be beneficial because,

+ it is a no-cost, user-friendly solution that can be used by anybody without requiring any installation or setup;
+ if used on a widescale, then 
+ Using even lesser parameters than a physician would require, this solution produced an effective accuracy of 99% in detecting chronic kidney disease over a test data.
